This project emphasis my journey on Data Science and it shows the basic understanding of the use of some python libraries whcih are majorly used in the field of Data Science. 
The python libraries used in this project include pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. A basic visual representation is shown in the file 'bitcoin_prices_student' it is used in jupyter notebook worked on it.
Also the dataset is also included in it called 'bitcoin_prices' as it is in 'xlsx' format . So kindly use "read_xlsx()"  from pandas library to access it as a dataframe.
